# Munch and crunch hands on workshop using power BI

In today's session we will cover some basics on Data analytics using Power BI. 
Specifically, we will focus on some of the data preparation activities including 

- how to connect to multiple data sources to extract data that is required for your analysis
- how to prepare the data for analysis
- how to build a data model

After the quick debrief on some of the concepts, we will dive into the hands on session.

## Lab Overview

Read the introduction - [Lab scenario introduction](https://github.com/BDO-Australia/MunchAndCrunch/blob/master/Session2/1.%20Lab%20Introduction.md) 

This lab comprises of three exercises:

1. [Exercise 1](https://github.com/BDO-Australia/MunchAndCrunch/blob/master/Session2/2.%20Exercise-1.md): import data to Power BI Desktop from an SQL database running on Microsoft Azure. 
2. [Exercise 2](https://github.com/BDO-Australia/MunchAndCrunch/blob/master/Session2/3.%20Exercise-2.md): import data from CSV files which resides in a file folder. You will append this new data to the corresponding existing data that comes from the Azure SQL Database. 
3. [Exercise 3](https://github.com/BDO-Australia/MunchAndCrunch/blob/master/Session2/4.%20Exercise-3.md): import data to Power BI Desktop from an Excel file that is less structured.
