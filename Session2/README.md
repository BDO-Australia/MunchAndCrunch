2. import data from CSV files which resides in a file folder. You will append this new data to the corresponding existing data that comes from the Azure SQL Database. [Excercise 2](https://github.com/BDO-Australia/MunchAndCrunch/blob/master/Session2/3.%20Excercise-2.md)
3. import data to Power BI Desktop from an Excel file that is less structured. [Excercise 3](https://github.com/BDO-Australia/MunchAndCrunch/blob/master/Session2/4.%20Excercise-3.md)
